### Author: Devlin H. Costello
## Description
This repository will contain all of the homework and lab assignments from APPM 4600 (Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing) in The Spring 2024 Semester.

## Lab 1
- Built out matrix vector multiplication function from a dot product function
- Compared runtimes with large matrices/vectors of the built method vs. numpy
- Basic plotting of vectors with both linear and loglog axis

## Homework 1
- Comparisons of Numerical Stability for different representations of the same problem
- Applying these comparisons to both Polynomial and Trigonometric Functions
